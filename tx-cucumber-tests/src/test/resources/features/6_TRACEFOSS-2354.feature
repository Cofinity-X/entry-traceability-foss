	#h2. User Story
	#
	#*As a user* of Trace-X
	#*I want* to be able to search, sort, filter for specificÂ  data like "ID, Part Number, etc."
	#*so that* I only see relevant data and I'm able to handle big amount of data
	#
	#--> This User Story should cover all Backend tasks that are necessary to cover the funcionalities in the frontend
	#h2. Outcome
	# - Sorting, Filtering, Searching possible in table view of Trace-X

	#Check if *owner filter* in *assets* is working correctly including:
	#* filter without owner specification returns assets of all owner
	#* filter for owner specification only return desired assets
  @TRACEFOSS-1221 @TRACEFOSS-1101 @INTEGRATION_TEST
  Scenario Outline: [BE] Check correct filtering of owner in assets
    When I am logged into TRACE_X_A application
    And I request assets with <owner-filter>
    Then I check, if only assets with <owner-filter> are responded

    Examples:
      | owner-filter |
      | "SUPPLIER"   |
      | "CUSTOMER"   |
      | "OWN"        |
