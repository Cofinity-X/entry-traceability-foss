|Components |Description

|IRS
|The IRS consumes relationship information across the CX-network and builds the graph view.

|EDC consumer
|The EDC consumer component is there to fulfill the GAIA-X and IDSA-data sovereignty principles. The EDC consumer is composed of a control plane and a data plane.

|EDC provider
|The EDC provider component connects with EDC consumer component and forms the endpoint for the actual exchange of data. It handles automatic contract negotiation and the subsequent exchange of data assets for connected applications.

|Submodel server
|The submodel server offers endpoints for requesting the submodel aspects.

|DiscoveryFinder
|Discovery Finder service enables the lookup of the suitable BPN Discovery services.

|EDC Discovery Service
| The EDC discovery service as defined in CX-0001 supports to find EDC endpoints of participants of the data space via BPNs, CX-0010. In some use cases the BPN is not known at the start of the process. This means that all EDCs in the data space need to be accessed to find a specific EDC data asset under consideration. This broadcasting has very low performance and produces a high access load on the EDCs.
