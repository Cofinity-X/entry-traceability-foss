= Safety and security concepts

== Authentication / Authorization

=== Trace-X API

The Trace-X is secured using OAuth2.0 / Open ID Connect.
Every request to the Trace-X API requires a valid bearer token.
JWT token should also contain two claims:

- 'bpn' which is equal to the configuration value from `API_ALLOWED_BPN` property
- 'resource_access' with the specific key for C-X environments.
The list of values will be converted to roles by Trace-X.
Currently, Trace-X API handles three roles: **'User'** and **'Supervisor'** and **'Admin'.**

The behavior is shown in the table below.

=== Trace-X as EDC client

The Trace-X accesses the Catena-X network via the EDC consumer connector.
This component requires authentication via a Verifiable Credential (VC), which is provided to the EDC via the Managed Identity Wallet.

The VC identifies and authenticates the EDC and is used to acquire access permissions for the data transferred via EDC.

== Credentials

Credentials must never be stored in Git!
