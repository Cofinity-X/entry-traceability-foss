Trace-X is developed using Java and the Spring Boot framework for the backend and Typescript based on the Angular framework for the frontend. This decision was taken due to the support of the frameworks as well as technical knowledge of the team members.

The application can be hosted using Docker and Kubernetes. This is commonly used and widespread. With this the application has no vendor lock in regarding the hosting provider.

The communication between frontend and backend is done using REST APIs. This is the standard method in the Catena-X landscape and makes the application components easy to use for any third party client.

For the database PostgreSQL is used.
