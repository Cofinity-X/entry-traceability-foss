This sequence diagram describes the two processes necessary for fetching data from the DTR and the Catena-X ecosystem with the IRS:

== Overview

Trace-X retrieves Asset Administration Shell (AAS) data by interacting with the Digital Twin Registry (DTR), Item Relationship Service (IRS), and its own consumer EDC.
The process begins with Trace-X querying the DTR for digital twins filtered by a configured Business Partner Number (BPN) and specific digital twin types (e.g., partType and partInstance). The DTR responds with a paginated list of aasIDs. For each page, Trace-X compares the AAS identifiers with those stored in its database and creates or updates entries as needed.
To fetch detailed submodel data, Trace-X identifies outdated or missing AAS entries from its local database. These are processed in batches according to a configurable batchSize. Each batch is registered as an order with the IRS, which returns submodel data. Trace-X then extracts relevant structures—such as relationships, shells, tombstones, submodels, and business partner numbers (BPNs)—and merges the results into its backend.
This pipeline ensures that part structures, including supplier and customer parts and their hierarchical relationships, are kept up to date in alignment with the AAS standard.
