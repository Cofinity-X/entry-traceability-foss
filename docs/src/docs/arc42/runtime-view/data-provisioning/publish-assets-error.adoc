== Overview

When a user publishes assets, Trace-X checks if the user has an adequate role ('ROLE_ADMIN').
If yes, then the endpoint starts to publish assets to network.
If any of required services are not available or return an error response upon executing, flow assets are set to ERROR state and the user can retry publishing them at any time when services are available again.
