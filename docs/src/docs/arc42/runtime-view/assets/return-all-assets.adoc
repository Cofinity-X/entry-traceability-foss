= Scenario 1: Return Assets

This section describes what happens when user lists stored assets.
In this example, the user requests as built assets.
The same can be done with as planned assets.

==== Overview

When a user requests stored assets, TraceX-FOSS checks if the user has an adequate role ('ROLE_ADMIN', 'ROLE_SUPERVISOR', 'ROLE_USER').
If yes, then the endpoint returns a pageable result of assets.

The returned pageable result can be empty if no suitable asset has been found.
