== Overview

Trace-X includes a scheduled cleanup mechanism to maintain data integrity in its local database.
At fixed intervals, a cron job triggers the cleanup process.
During this process, Trace-X queries the database for expired Asset Administration Shell (AAS)
entries based on their time-to-live (TTL). If any expired entries are found, they are removed from the database,
and a corresponding log message is written. If no expired entries exist,
Trace-X logs that no cleanup was necessary. This ensures outdated twin data does not accumulate over time.
