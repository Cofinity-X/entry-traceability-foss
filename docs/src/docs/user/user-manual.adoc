image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse-tractusx/traceability-foss/main/docs/src/images/arc42/user-guide/ess-investigation-part-selection.png[]

By clicking the second "Create ESS investigation" button, situated on the right side of this list, you will open a third panel, to choose or enter a BPNS.

==== Choosing the BPNS

In order to have a correct BPNS, this form offers a look-up for this, based on the company information, like name, location, street name, etc.

But also, if you are sure about it, you can enter the BPNS without searching for a company.

Every investigation has the "INITIAL" status. This is update based on subsequent IRS interrogations, based on the job ID assigned the investigation. This interrogation is done by a scheduled task, running in the backend. How often should this run, you can set by defining the ess.initialDelayForIrsJobStatusCheck environment variable.

=== Creating new investigation using the parts as planned list

You also can create such investigation using the parts as planned list.
