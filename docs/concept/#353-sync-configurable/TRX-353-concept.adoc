== Registering Orders

This document outlines the workflows for registering orders within the system. Orders can be triggered either automatically based on the Time-To-Live (TTL) of parts or manually via a REST-API by an Admin. Both processes share a common structure, with differences primarily in the initiation step.

=== Process Overview

1. **Triggering the Order Registration**:
- **CronJob-based**: A `CronJob` triggers `TraceX` to check for parts with expired TTL by querying `TraceXDB`.
- **REST-API-based**: An `Admin` manually registers an order via the REST-API, sending tuples of `globalAssetId`, `BPN`, and order configurations to `TraceX`.

2. **Registering Orders**:
- In both cases, `TraceX` registers the order with the `IRS`, including the provided tuples (`globalAssetId`, `BPN`, and order configurations).
- `IRS` responds with an `OrderID`.

3. **Persisting Data**:
- `TraceX` persists the `OrderID` in the `Orders` table of `TraceXDB`.
- The state of each part involved is updated to `"In Synchronisation"` in the `parts` table.

4. **Order Status Updates**:
- `IRS` sends callbacks to `TraceX` with updates, including `OrderId`, `OrderState`, `BatchId`, and `BatchState`.
- `TraceX` persists the updated order status and `OrderId` in the `Orders` table.
- The `BatchId` and `BatchState` will not be persisted.
- Multiple callbacks will always override the current order status.

=== Key Differences

==== Trigger Mechanism:
- *CronJob-based*: Automatically triggered based on TTL of parts.
- *REST-API-based*: Manually triggered by an Admin via REST-API.

==== Initial Data Source:
- *CronJob-based*: `TraceX` queries `TraceXDB` to identify parts with expired TTL.
- *REST-API-based*: Data is provided directly by the Admin in the API request.

== Sync Completed/Partial Orders from IRS

This process ensures that parts related to completed and partially completed orders (meeting a time threshold) are synchronized from the Item Relationship Service (IRS) to the TraceX system.

=== Process Overview

1. **Trigger Sync:** A `CronJob` triggers the synchronization in `TraceX` for orders with:
- Status `COMPLETED`
- Status `PARTIAL`, only if the `updated_at` time threshold is met

2. **Query Orders:** `TraceX` queries `TraceXDB` for relevant orders based on the above criteria.

3. **Fetch Order Details:** For each identified order:
- `TraceX` requests order details from `IRS` using the `OrderID`
- `IRS` responds with parts data (`PartsAsBuilt` or `PartsAsPlanned`)

4. **Persist Data:** `TraceX` stores the parts data in `TraceXDB`.

5. **Update TTL:** The Time-to-Live (TTL) for each part is updated to determine when the part should be synced again, ensuring data freshness and efficient resource usage.

=== Key Notes
- The time threshold is based on the `updated_at` field, defining when partial orders qualify for resynchronization.
- TTL updates provide transparency for future sync cycles, optimizing system performance.
